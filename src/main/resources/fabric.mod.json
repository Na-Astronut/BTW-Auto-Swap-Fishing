  "description": "A mod for lazy people who hate long fishing sessions—the creator is one of them! Fishing becomes easy. You just need bait in your inventory, and it will automatically hook the fish. Hooks (for switching when your current one breaks) must be in your hot bars only, not in your inventory.\n\nHow to use the mod:\nSimply have bait and a hook in your inventory (hooks in the hot bar only), cast your line, and enjoy fishing while you sit back and watch your hook break.\n\nThis is my first mod, and it uses AI.\nIf you have any problems or errors, please let me know.",
